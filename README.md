# Student Behavioral Analysis: Digital Usage & Academic Performance

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the intersection of student behavior, digital habits, and academic achievement. Using Python-based statistical analysis, the study investigates how variables like **Generative AI adoption (ChatGPT, Gemini)**, **Social Media usage**, and **Internet consumption** correlate with student **GPAs** across various fields of study including Statistics, Computer Science, and Medical sciences.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Comprehensive EDA:** Exploratory Data Analysis to identify demographic trends and internet usage patterns among undergraduate and graduate students.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Implementation of contingency tables and frequency mapping to find correlations between digital distractions and academic performance.
* **AI Impact Tracking:** Analysis of the adoption rate of Generative AI tools (ChatGPT/Gemini) as a primary internet usage type.
* **Advanced Visualization:** * **Stacked Bar Charts:** Visualizing SNS (Social Networking Sites) usage vs. GPA categories.
    * **Heatmaps:** Comparing Observed vs. Expected frequencies to identify significant behavioral outliers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:**
    * `Pandas`: Data manipulation and cleaning.
    * `Matplotlib`: Base plotting and visualization.
    * `Seaborn`: Advanced statistical heatmaps and styling.
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Findings (Summary)
* Analyzed the shift from traditional web browsing to **Generative AI applications** among top-performing students.
* Identified a correlation between **Internet Usage Time (>6 hours)** and reported academic distraction levels.
* Mapped GPA distribution across fields of study, highlighting how different disciplines utilize digital resources.
